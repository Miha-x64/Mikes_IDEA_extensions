<h2><code>&lt;bitmap android:tint&gt;</code></h2>

<h2><code>&lt;include layout="?attr"&gt;</code></h2>

    <code>LayoutInflater</code> resolves the value of <code>&lt;include&gt;</code>'s <code>layout</code> attribute correctly
    only since <a href="https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/commit/33e3cdab5bb20fc265b75b541fd9e1837269cc50"
>this commit</a>, Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.
</p>
<p>
    On earlier versions you may use <code>&lt;ViewStub&gt;</code> as a workaround.

<hr/>

<p>
    Given that XML layouts are super crappy and not mature enough even after a decade of Android evolution,
    I personally recommend you a global fix: throw them away and use
    <a href="https://github.com/LouisCAD/Splitties/tree/master/modules/views-dsl">Splitties View DSL</a>,
    or roll your own UI DSL in one hour and 100 LoC which will suit your needs.
